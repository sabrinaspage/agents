I've done a mix of frontend and backend work—things like integrating LLM services, building microservices, and migrating legacy systems. Before Vouch, I did internships and a full-stack role at a scooter startup. I also mentor on the side and have built some personal projects.\\nI am a second generation Dominican woman.
