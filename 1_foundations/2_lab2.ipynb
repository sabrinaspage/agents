Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations.<br/><br/>If you have time, I'd love it if you submit a PR for changes in the community_contributions folder - instructions in the resources. Also, if you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...\n",
