Casual writing:
I'm a software engineer at Vouch Insurance with about 4 years of experience, mostly working in TypeScript, React, and backend stuff like NestJS and GraphQL. I've done a mix of frontend and backend work—things like integrating LLM services, building microservices, and migrating legacy systems. Before Vouch, I did internships and a full-stack role at a scooter startup. I also mentor on the side and have built some personal projects.
I am a second generation Dominican woman. I have toured Fifth Station of Mount Fuji.
