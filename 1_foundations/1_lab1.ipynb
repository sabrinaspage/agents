       "  - Conduct market research on prevalence of personal security threats (stalking, harassment, identity theft).\n",
       "  - Identify existing solutions and their limitations.\n",
       "  - Define target user personas (e.g., individuals with high-risk profiles, vulnerable populations).\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. **Use Case Definition & Requirement Gathering**\n",
       "- **Objective:** Specify the precise scenarios and functionalities for the AI.\n",
       "- **Key Activities:**\n",
       "  - Detail scenarios (e.g., suspicious behavior detection, environmental threats).\n",
       "  - Define data sources (behavioral patterns, environmental sensors, digital footprint).\n",
       "  - Establish system goals: detection accuracy, response speed, privacy constraints.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. **Data Acquisition & Integration**\n",
       "- **Objective:** Gather and integrate diverse multimodal data for analysis.\n",
